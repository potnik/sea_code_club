# Week 2

For week 2 we spent more time walking through the [Happy Birthday](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/happy-birthday) lesson.
We spent a lot of time reviewing basic tags and page structure.  By now, you should have a basic webpage.  It is important that you understand the basic web tags so we can move forward in coming weeks:
 ```html
 <html></html>
 <head></head>
 <title></title>
 <body></body>
 <h1></h1>
 <p></p>
 <b></b>
 <i></i>
 <u></u>
 <br>
 ```
Towards the end of the session, we started to look at adding style to our page with CSS.
 ```css
 body {
    background: white;
  }
  p {
    color: black;  
  }
 ```
 Remember:  Coding is very precise.  Tags need to be nested and closed properly.  CSS is particular about punctuation.
