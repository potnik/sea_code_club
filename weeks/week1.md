# Week 1 - Welcome to Code Club

Thanks for coming to our first Code Club meeting.  I started Code Club to give students a chance to move beyond Scratch and other graphical coding environments.  In Code Club, you will be typing code -- so much typing...

This week will set up with our Trinket.io accounts and learned to navigate around the development environment.

Then we will work through as many of the python language basics we can in an hour. We'll be following along with the lessons here:
