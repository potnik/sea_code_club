# Week 3 - More HTML

Week three we worked on more HTML and CSS digging deeper into the Happy Birthday project found [Here](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/webdev/happy-birthday/) and with this [Trinket](http://jumpto.cc/web-intro)

We looked at various ways to change the look and feel of the card using HTML tags and CSS as well as playing with changing the image on the inside and outside fo the card.

Finally, we talked about the Javascript that was included in the project although Javascript is outside the scope of this lesson.
