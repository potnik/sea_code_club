# Week 10 - More Snow and Wrap Up

So this was the week I was hoping to dive into some hardware resources such as the Raspberry Pi and BBC micro:bit as well as wrap up what we learned.  Unfortunately we were snowed out again and in this case two strikes and we were out.

I posted the links I shared in my final email on the front page \([README.md](../README.md)\) of this repo.  I hope you find them useful.

Python is an easy to use, but powerful language.  You can make a career in just coding in Python or use it as a jumping off point for more complex languages (like Java, C and C++).  I hope our code club will inspire you to learn more.

Thanks for attending.
